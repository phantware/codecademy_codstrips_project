# codecademy_codstrips_project
## Cumulative Project: Codestrips
Codestrips is a small application to allow users to create and save small one-pane comic strips.

You can select a head, body, background location, thought/speech bubble type, thought/speech bubble text, and caption for a strip. By the end of this project, youâ€™ll be able to save these to a SQLite database and retrieve them so that they persist even when you restart your server.
